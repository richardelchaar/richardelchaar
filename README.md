# I'm Richard, welcome to my GitHub profile!

## ðŸš€ **Aerospace Engineer Turned Data Enthusiast** ðŸŒŒ  
With a background in aerospace engineering, I worked on solving intricate problems and optimizing complex systems; skills that naturally led me to data engineering. Now, Iâ€™m applying that same mindset to design scalable pipelines and transform raw data into meaningful insights.

## ðŸ›  My Mission

Iâ€™m focused on mastering data engineering, creating dependable pipelines, scalable systems, and streamlined workflows to turn raw data into practical insights. Alongside this, Iâ€™m exploring machine learning to build and deploy predictive models and experimenting with generative AI to push the boundaries of what data can do.

## ðŸŒŸ Featured Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on so far, more to come!
- [Featback](https://github.com/richardelchaar/featback)  
  The Feature-Level Product Review Analysis Tool. An end-to-end batch data processing pipeline using AWS services, GPT LLM, Airflow and Docker
- [Drone Telemetry Streaming](https://github.com/richardelchaar/drone-telemetry-streaming)  
  A real-time drone monitoring and analysis system that streams telemetry data, performs on-the-fly analysis, and visualizes insights. This Dockerized pipeline was built using Kafka for data streaming, Spark for processing, Cassandra for low latency data storage and real-time dashboards powered by Grafana.
- [Predicting Police Bias](https://github.com/richardelchaar/predicting-police-bias)  
  Predicting systemic disparities in NYC law enforcement using stop-and-frisk data and financial metrics. Supervised ML models like Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting uncover patterns of bias, driving actionable insights for equity.
