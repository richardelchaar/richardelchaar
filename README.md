# I'm Richard. Welcome to my Portfolio!

My background in aerospace engineering trained me to solve complex problems with a first-principles, systems-level mindset. I've carried that same rigorous approach into the field of machine learning, where my focus is on bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI concepts and tangible business value.

I don't just build models; I engineer end-to-end solutions. My work spans the full ML lifecycle, from architecting scalable data infrastructure to deploying intelligent, automated systems that drive measurable impact.

## üåü Featured Architectures

Here are the blueprints for some of the primary systems I've designed and built.

### [Advertis: The Anti-Ad Ad Platform](https://github.com/richardelchaar/advertis-platform)

Advertis is a monetization platform for conversational AI that replaces traditional, disruptive ads with seamless, narrative-first product placements. It uses a sophisticated multi-agent system to analyze the conversation's context and creatively weave in relevant products, turning a potential cost center into a revenue generator while enhancing user immersion.

**Tools Used: LangGraph, RAG, ChromaDB, FastAPI, Redis, Docker, Pytest, Streamlit, PostgreSQL.**

### [AttritionGuard: The AI HR Strategist](https://github.com/richardelchaar/Employee-Attrition-MLOps)

AttritionGuard is a full-stack MLOps platform designed to predict employee attrition and simulate the effectiveness of various retention strategies. It moves beyond simple prediction by using causal inference to answer "what-if" questions for HR leaders. The system is built on a fully autonomous pipeline that automatically monitors for data drift and triggers model retraining and redeployment without human intervention.

**Tools Used: scikit-learn, MLFlow, GitHub Actions, Evidently Drift Detection, SHAP, Causal Inference, FastAPI, Streamlit, Docker, Azure SQL DB.**

### [Featback: The Corporate Mind-Reader](https://github.com/richardelchaar/featback)

Featback is an automated product intelligence platform that uses Generative AI to perform deep analysis on unstructured customer reviews. Instead of basic sentiment scores, it performs Aspect-Based Emotion Analysis‚Äîextracting the specific product feature, the user's emotion, and the root cause behind their feedback. This transforms chaotic text into a structured, actionable dataset for product teams.

**Tools Used: Airflow, AWS (S3, Redshift, QuickSight), LLMs, Terraform, Docker.**

## üî¨ Some Other Projects

This is a selection of projects exploring core ML concepts and specialized data systems.

  * [Drone Telemetry Data Streaming Framework](https://github.com/richardelchaar/drone-telemetry-streaming)

    > Engineered a real-time data pipeline to process high-throughput drone telemetry, using a modern streaming stack **(Kafka, Spark Streaming, Cassandra)** to provide a foundation for live analytics and anomaly detection models.

  * [Multi-class Text Classification with Transformers](https://github.com/richardelchaar/Transformers-text-classification)

    > A deep dive into deploying modern NLP classifiers. I fine-tuned **BERT** on the **20 Newsgroups** dataset, then went beyond training to analyze its predictions with **LIME** and package it for production by exporting the model to **ONNX** and benchmarking its CPU inference speed.

  * [Unmasking Bias in Law Enforcement](https://github.com/richardelchaar/predicting-police-bias)

    > A data science project for social good that merges NYPD records with financial data to train a model predicting unjustified police actions. Used **feature importance analysis** to provide a quantitative tool for equity-focused reform.

  * [CIFAR-10/100 Image Classification with Compact ResNets](https://github.com/richardelchaar/ResNet9-image-classification)

    > A systematic ablation study on CNNs, demonstrating through rigorous experimentation that optimized training strategies and regularization can allow a compact **ResNet-9** to outperform a deeper model on a constrained budget.

  * [Shakespearean Text Generation with RNNs](https://github.com/richardelchaar/RNN-text-generation)

    > A foundational deep dive into sequence modeling. Implemented and benchmarked **LSTMs, GRUs, and vanilla RNNs** to compare architectures, training methods (Teacher Forcing), and generation techniques (Temperature Sampling vs. Beam Search).
